# React Project Tasks

Cross out what is completed

## Implement Form and Content Markup

Fairly straight forward. All form elements need to be interactive

## Theme/Style components to match design

I should probably use Styled Components here since it seems the most straightforward. It does not need to match the CSS from the Figma precisely. Furthermore, I should aim to use rem sizes.

## Add Plus/Minus button behaviors for Numeric Inputs

These parts can be modularlized Components like with VueJS

## Submit and Zero Out

If "Complete your booking" is clicked, zero out all fields.
